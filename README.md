# 'Delicious' Safari Extension

This safari extension adds two things:

- A _toolbar button_

  Opens a new tab with the delicious add page and prefills it with
  the current site you are on.

- A _context menu item_

  When right-clicking on a link and chosing 'Delicious Bookmark
  Link' a new tab is opened with the delicious add page and
  prefilled with the selected link data.
